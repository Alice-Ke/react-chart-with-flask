1. Run server.py with 
		FLASK_APP=server.py flask run 
   separately, and then run React app. Since I am doing another React project on another port, so I change this port to 3010.

2. install flask_cors python module first

3. getDummySentence() function in App.js is the one communicates with flask server.


Best,
Alice
